# automating-TUG-events-posting
A project to automate the posting of Tableau User Group events to Convo. Events are downloaded from the Tableau User Group website as JSON and then parsed and written to a CSV using Python. The Python Snowflake Connector is then used to stage the CSV and upload the data to The Information Lab's Snowflake server. The script creates two tables and populates one with accessible events and the other with upcoming accessible events. Zapier (external to this repository) is used to detect new rows in either of these tables and is configured to post to Convo when new rows are added.
